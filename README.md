# P2PFileSystem
A Peer to Peer file system built on top of FUSE (File System in User Space ). 
P2PFS is an inmemory file system meaning that all files and directories created 
will not exist once that filesystem is unmounted.


# Installing FUSE
In order to get the filesystem working several conditions need to be met.

Ubuntu: FUSE is not Windows supported by default. The FUSE Kernel Module is not installed and even if you use 
the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you'll run to this problem.

While FUSE comes pre installed with most versions of Linux we still need extra supportting software to support building our file system.
With a fresh install of Ubuntu, download and install the following.


## FUSE Requirements

On the Ubuntu Terminal.

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install fuse
* sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev

Download the fuse library of functions
https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse

In order to test if libfuse is working well
Will need the following

meson and ninja needed to build libfuse 
* sudo apt-get install meson

For Meson to work we need to build essentials
* sudo apt-get upgrade
* sudo apt-get install build essential
* sudo apt-get install pkg-config

Need Python3 to run the tests to see if FUSE is working
* sudo apt-get install python3.7
* sudo apt-get install python3-pip
* pip3 install --user pytest

Then just follow instructions on libfuse github readMe
until you see passing tests. Make sure a majority of the tests pass.

Now your OS is ready to support a FUSE filesystem. 



## Building the File System
The src Folder contains the program for our FUSE file system. 

Once in src just run the Make file using the command Make.
Once refreFS wil be the program that will be ran in order
to build the filesystem.

## Testing and Running

Currently we are debugging the program using GDB. In order
to run the program using GDB in the src folder hit the command

* gdb refreshFS

Once in the gdb environment you can run the command
* file refreshFS

This will allow you to set break points using the command 'b [line number]'.

To skip the break points once entering gdb just enter

 * run -s -d Mountdir
 * -s: Runs the file system as a single thread program
 * -d: Allows for debugging options
 * Mountdir: is the name of the folder that will be tourned to our mounting point.

ctrl c and q exits the program.




To unmount use the instruction

* fusermount -u [mounting point]



## About the File System

The base of our P2P file system started out from. LSYSFS, a less simple yet stupid file system.
LSYSFS is a in memory(all files disapear on dismount) file system that is as simple as it gets, it reads only one directory level down. With 
LSYSFS as a base we looked at how each function worked. What does each function need? What does it return?
Having a basic understanding of how the file system worked we could then build on top of it by looking at 
more feature complete file systems and how they handle routines that every file system needs. 


### Pre Req Knowledge

Before you dive in there are some things you must know.

* Everything is a file, even am a file
In Unix everything is a file. Yes that means a directory is a file too. 


* Paths
You need to know what's the difference between a relative path and an absolute path. 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46121000/what-is-an-absolute-pathname-vs-a-relative-pathname

Whenver you have to deal with an object(file or directory) in our filesystem, fuse will scan everything in a directory and return
the path of files and directories. Say you want to write some file, Fuse will send a write request
to our file system with the full path "/mountdir/filename". If your file is in the root of your file system it will look like "/filename".


* Inodes
Files and their contents are not stored together but are found together with their index position. The relationship will help us find the file and its contents. Inodes are a data structure in unix type file systemsthat describe a file or directory. Inodes store the attributes and disk block locations
of the objects data. File-system object attributes may include metadata (times of last change, access, modification), as well as owner and permission data. Directories are lists of names assigned to inodes. A directory contains an entry for itself, its parent, and each of its children. As you have seen you can't create a directory or file of the same name because a list is maintaining each file and its unique name.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode


Below are the functions we explored and what they do.

* getattr: 

This function gets the file attributes. Basically it tells the OS if this is a file or directory. It's perhaps the first step that hapens in fuse, if you don't make an init function.
"Also, it tells about the owner, group and permission bits of the object. This function is a vital one that without it we canâ€™t have a functional filesystem"





## Resources

* If you were looking for FUSE resources before hand this was perhaps the first link that popped up.
Don't listen to anything about the FUSE set up, that's an older version that caused us issues. Instead
just pay attention the function descriptions. That's probably the most useful information you'll get.
